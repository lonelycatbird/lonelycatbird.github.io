        <h1>The artwork</h1>
        <p>The cat thinks that he is lonely but he is not really lonely, there is a bird beside him. Many people think that they are alone in this world, but the truth is we are not alone there are people around us. I hope that this art will help people realize that there are living things around us. If you are struggling in your life and felt that there is no one to reach out, just go out and see the world, walk around the park, look at the sky, and never think you are alone.</p>
